Code Changes Summary:

1. Renamed short and unclear variable names (, , , , , ) to more descriptive ones such as , , , and .c, a, b, bI, bD, bR, counter, increase, decrease, reset

2. Extracted the repeated counter-update logic into a single function to remove duplicated code.updateCounter()

3. Added proper TypeScript type annotations (, ) and a return type to satisfy strict type checking.count: HTMLElementas HTMLElement: void

4. Used instead of for better practice and type safety.textContentinnerHTML
